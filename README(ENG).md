#  Artificial Intelligence - Vision
##  What is it?
Its a field of science related to creating computers and machines that can reason, learn, and act in ways that would normally require human intelligence or involve data on a scale beyond what humans can analyze.

## How does it work?
This learning process typically involves algorithms, which are sets of rules or instructions that guide the AI's analysis and decision-making. In machine learning, a popular subset of AI, algorithms are trained on labeled or unlabeled data to make predictions or categorize information.

## Vision 
Computer vision is a field of AI that enables computers and systems to extract meaningful information from digital images, videos, and other visual inputs, and take actions or make recommendations based on that information.

## OpenCV
Its an open-source library that contains implementations spanning over 2500 algorithms. Additionally, it specializes in computer vision systems and machine learning.

## MediaPipe
Its a framework for developing ML pipelines to process time series of data such as videos or audios. Through this framework, different solutions have been developed such as pose, hand, or face detectors; object detection or people segmentation, etc.

## Numpy
The term NumPy is the abbreviation of “Numerical Python”. Its an open source Python library. It is used for scientific programming in Python, in particular for programming in Data Science, engineering, mathematics or science.

## Differences between AI Vision, AI NLP, and AI LLM
||AI Vision | AI NPL |AI LLM
|--|--|--|--|
| **Objective** | enable machines to interpret and understand images and videoss |interaction between computers and human languages|large language models trained on massive text datasets
| **Applications** | facial recognition, image analysis, video surveillance, etc |machine translation, sentiment analysis, text classification, etc|automatic summarization, auto-coding, article generation, etc
| **Techniques** | image processing, image segmentation, and edge detection |syntactic analysis, semantic analysis, and word embeddings|pretraining and fine-tuning on large text datasets


## Library installation
To install the libraries used, run the following commands:
- **OpenCV:** pip install opencv-python
- **MediaPipe:** pip install mediapipe
- **NumPy:** pip install numpy

> If you want to install all of them at once, run this line: </br> pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy
