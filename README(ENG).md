#  Artificial Intelligence - Vision
##  What is it?
It is a field of science related to creating computers and machines that can reason, learn, and act in ways that would normally require human intelligence or involve data on a scale beyond what humans can analyze.

## How does it work?
This learning process typically involves algorithms, which are sets of rules or instructions that guide the AI's analysis and decision-making. In machine learning, a popular subset of AI, algorithms are trained on labeled or unlabeled data to make predictions or categorize information.

## Vision 
Computer vision is a field of AI that enables computers and systems to extract meaningful information from digital images, videos, and other visual inputs, and take actions or make recommendations based on that information.

## OpenCV
It is an open-source library that contains implementations spanning over 2500 algorithms. Additionally, it specializes in computer vision systems and machine learning.

## Differences between AI Vision, AI NLP, and AI LLM
||AI Vision | AI NPL |AI LLM
|--|--|--|--|
| **Objective** | enable machines to interpret and understand images and videoss |interaction between computers and human languages|large language models trained on massive text datasets
| **Applications** | facial recognition, image analysis, video surveillance, etc |machine translation, sentiment analysis, text classification, etc|automatic summarization, auto-coding, article generation, etc
| **Techniques** | image processing, image segmentation, and edge detection |syntactic analysis, semantic analysis, and word embeddings|pretraining and fine-tuning on large text datasets
